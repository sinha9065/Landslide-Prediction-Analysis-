# Landslide-Prediction-Analysis-
A data science project to predict landslides using ML(internship at NOVANECTAR SERVICES PVT.LTD.)
# Landslide Prediction Analysis

This project was completed as part of my internship at *NOVANECTAR SERVICES PVT. LTD.*  
It uses Python and machine learning models like *Random Forest* and *SVM* to predict landslide-prone areas.

## Tools & Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Steps:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Visualization
- Model Training
- Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

üìç Completed during my BSc Data Science 2nd year internship.
